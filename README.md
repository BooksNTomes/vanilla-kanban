# Vanilla-Kanban : Vanilla HTML,CSS,Javascript (no frameworks or node.js)
- A simple kanban board application. Create 'todo' sections and drag-and-droppable tasks.
- Intended to be used locally (serverless).
- Heavily inspired by Trello.

# About
- Vanilla-Kanban is under development as part of studying project management and construction of simple applications. It will serve as a personal and offline Kanban Board tool that can open and save boards locally.

# Installation Instructions
- Ensure that the three files 'index.html', 'script.js', and 'styles.js' are in the same folder

# How to Use
- Open the app by opening index.html
- Tasks/Sections
  - Create sections/tasks using the add buttons.
  - Edit/delete sections/tasks using the configure buttons.
- Boards
  - Save boards in a directory and filename of your choosing
  - Open saved boards using the same directory/filename

# Limitations
- No error handling is implemented for opening tasks/boards yet. Beware of unexpected behavior if you open a json file with contents that is not intended for the program.

# Updates
- The base features are complete, but additional features will be added overtime such as background color configuration, opening multiple boards, and code refactoring/redesign, and branches featuring different implementations (such as servers / database technologies / frameworks) may be done.

- Duck.ai and internet searching for ideas on certain implementations (e.g. 'downloading/uploading' without server/node.js)
